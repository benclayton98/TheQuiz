# TheQuiz

How I want this to look:

1. User loads the loading screen and clicks to begin.
2. The first question is randomly generated from the database and is displayed on the screen.
3. The user types their answer into the text box which is then compared to the answer in the database.
4. The user will be notified of the result and there will be a tally of how many they have gotten correct so far.
5. At the end the user will be notified of their success rate and have the option to retake another quiz.

Extended (if time)

1. The user can login and have their results saved in a separate database table.
2. A leaderboard can be displayed to see who is the best.
